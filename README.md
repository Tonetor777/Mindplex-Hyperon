# Mindplex Hyperon

Mindplex Hyperon is a robust, transparent, and explainable recommendation engine that leverages [AtomSpace](https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/), a metagraph-based knowledge graph developed by the OpenCog project. AtomSpace provides a flexible, semantic framework for representing and querying relationships between concepts, supporting advanced reasoning and AI-driven applications.

The core aim of Mindplex Hyperon is to build recommendations that are not only accurate but also interpretable and trustworthy. By utilizing AtomSpace, the engine can mimic user behavior from historical data, constructing an agent that predicts how a user will interact with future content or features. This agent-based modeling enables the system to provide recommendations with clear, logical explanations, helping users understand the reasoning behind each suggestion.

Key features include:
- Transparent and explainable recommendations
- User-centric agent modeling based on interaction history
- Integration with AtomSpace for semantic knowledge representation
- Support for logic-based graph processing and advanced analytics

Mindplex Hyperon sets a new standard for recommendation systems by focusing on transparency, explainability, and robust knowledge graph integration. The project is designed for extensibility, allowing researchers and developers to build upon its foundation for a wide range of AI and data-driven applications.

## This Branch

This branch is dedicated to the experimental implementation of neuro-symbolic research papers, specifically those focused on graph-based recommendation systems. The goal is to explore, prototype, and evaluate cutting-edge approaches that combine neural and symbolic reasoning within the Mindplex Hyperon framework.

**Guidelines for contributors:**
- Select a relevant neuro-symbolic, graph-based recommendation paper for implementation.
- Document the chosen paper, your implementation approach, and analysis in the `docs` folder. This should include a summary of the paper, key algorithms or models, and how they are adapted or integrated into Mindplex Hyperon.
- Should create a dedicated folder for the implementaion in the root directory
- Ensure that your code is modular and follows the project's contribution standards.
- Provide clear explanations and comments to facilitate understanding and future development.

This branch serves as a collaborative space for advancing research and experimentation, helping to bridge the gap between academic innovation and practical, explainable AI systems.

## Testing

Each feature has associated test cases located in the `features/tests` directory. The test files are named with a `-test` suffix to facilitate CI/CD recognition. 

- **Feature One Tests**: Located in `features/tests/FeatureOne-test.metta`
- **Feature Two Tests**: Located in `features/tests/FeatureTwo-test.metta`

## CI/CD

This project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The CI/CD workflow is configured to run all test files upon every pull request to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
