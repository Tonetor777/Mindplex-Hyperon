# Mindplex Hyperon

Mindplex Hyperon is a robust, transparent, and explainable recommendation engine that leverages [AtomSpace](https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/), a metagraph-based knowledge graph developed by the OpenCog project. AtomSpace provides a flexible, semantic framework for representing and querying relationships between concepts, supporting advanced reasoning and AI-driven applications.

The core aim of Mindplex Hyperon is to build recommendations that are not only accurate but also interpretable and trustworthy. By utilizing AtomSpace, the engine can mimic user behavior from historical data, constructing an agent that predicts how a user will interact with future content or features. This agent-based modeling enables the system to provide recommendations with clear, logical explanations, helping users understand the reasoning behind each suggestion.

Key features include:
- Transparent and explainable recommendations
- User-centric agent modeling based on interaction history
- Integration with AtomSpace for semantic knowledge representation
- Support for logic-based graph processing and advanced analytics

Mindplex Hyperon sets a new standard for recommendation systems by focusing on transparency, explainability, and robust knowledge graph integration. The project is designed for extensibility, allowing researchers and developers to build upon its foundation for a wide range of AI and data-driven applications.
## This Branch

This branch is dedicated to the implementation and experimentation of symbolic approaches for graph-based recommendation systems. The focus is on leveraging symbolic reasoning, logic-based methods, and knowledge graph techniques within the Mindplex Hyperon framework.

**Guidelines for contributors:**
- Select a symbolic, graph-based recommendation method or algorithm for implementation.
- Document the selected approach, your implementation details, and analysis in the `docs` folder. Include a summary of the method, core algorithms or logic, and how it is adapted or integrated into Mindplex Hyperon.
- Create a dedicated folder named after the symbolic the algorithm you are implementing, in the root directory for your implementation.
- Ensure your code is modular and adheres to the project's contribution standards.
- Provide clear explanations and comments to support understanding and future enhancements.

This branch is a collaborative environment for advancing symbolic AI research and practical applications, supporting transparent and explainable recommendation systems.
