## Problem Statement

Knowledge Bases (KBs) suffer from **incompleteness** (due to the Open World Assumption) and **errors** (from automated extraction). RuDiK aims to automate the discovery of declarative rules to address these issues by both enriching KBs (positive rules) and detecting inconsistencies (negative rules).

## RuDiK Overview

RuDiK is a system that automatically discovers **declarative rules** (positive and negative) to improve KB data quality. It is robust to noise and incompleteness and uses an expressive rule language.

### Key Features:

* **Rule Discovery**: Finds positive rules (to add facts) and negative rules (to detect errors).
* **Robustness**: Tolerates significant data noise.
* **Accuracy**: Achieves high accuracy in fact inference and error detection.
* **Scalability**: Utilizes incremental algorithms for large KBs.

## System Workflow

### Input:
* A **Knowledge Base** and a **target predicate**.

### Steps:

1.  **Example Generation**:
    * **Positive (G)**: Existing true facts for the predicate.
    * **Negative (V)**: Counterexamples generated strategically using **LCWA (Local-Closed World Assumption)**. LCWA helps create meaningful false examples by focusing on semantically related entities.
        * *Example:* For `couple`, `(Malia, Natasha)` (sisters) would be in V.

2.  **Rule Mining**:
    * **Path Discovery**: Identifies paths between entities to form potential rules.
    * **Weight Calculation**: Assigns a quality `Weight` to each rule, prioritizing lower weights. The formula balances coverage over G and V using parameter `alpha`:
        $$\text{Weight} = \alpha \left(1 - \frac{|\text{r} \cap \text{G}|}{|\text{G}|}\right) + (1-\alpha) \left(\frac{|\text{r} \cap \text{V}|}{|\text{V}|}\right)$$
        * **High `alpha`**: Favors precision.
        * **Low `alpha`**: Favors recall.

3.  **Rule Execution**:
    * **Positive Rules**: Infer and add new facts.
    * **Negative Rules**: Flag inconsistencies.

## 3. Algorithm (Pseudocode + Example)

### Greedy Rule Selection:

```
Initialize R = empty set of rules  # R stores the selected optimal set of rules
While (uncovered examples in G exist):
  1. Find rule r* with lowest marginal_weight(r*, R)  # r* is the most beneficial rule
  2. If marginal_weight(r*, R) < 0:  # If adding r* reduces the total weight
     - Add r* to R
     - Remove examples covered by r* from G  # Update the set of uncovered positive examples
  3. Else: terminate  # No more beneficial rules can be found
```

### Example of Greedy Selection:
* **Target Predicate:** `couple`.
* **Positive (G):** `(Michelle, Barack)`.
* **Negative (V):** `(Malia, Natasha)`.
* **Discovered Rule:**
    ```prolog
    hasChild(a,c) ∧ hasChild(b,c) ⇒ couple(a,b)
    ```
* **Coverage:** Covers `(Michelle, Barack)` (✅) but not `(Malia, Natasha)` (✅), demonstrating good precision.

## 4. Conclusion & Potential Integration with Mindplex Hyperon

RuDiK provides an automated and robust solution for Knowledge Base curation by **discovering high-coverage positive and negative rules**. It effectively **balances precision and recall** using a weighted set cover approach and **scales to large KBs**.

The discovered rules can serve as high-quality training examples for **Machine Learning systems**. Specifically, RuDiK's ability to refine KB data could enhance **Mindplex Hyperon**, an explainable recommendation engine built on **AtomSpace**. This integration would improve AtomSpace's data quality, directly inform Mindplex Hyperon's transparent reasoning, and guide its agent-based modeling for more trustworthy recommendations.
